# Generate Time Series for Hydronic HVAC System

## Description
This measure will replace an existing HVAC system with a hydronic HVAC system (System 7, VAV with Reheat), and allows the user to change the temperature setpoints and design temperature differentials
	for the resulting hot water and chilled water loops. Though this measure adds primary equipment models (a chiller, cooling tower, and boiler) to the model, it is intended for generating demand-side load profiles, 
	which could also be used in modeling a district thermal energy system. This measure is intended for use with the reporting measures Add Output Variables for Hydronic HVAC Systems and Export Time Series Loads CSV.

## Modeler Description
This measure assumes that the heating and cooling hydronic loops are named as they are in the configuration generated by 
	the "Add Sys7 VAV w Reheat" measure. This measure implements the Add Sys7 VAV with Reheat Measure, as well as leveraging the "Add Output Variable" measure
	for particular output variables, and the "Ambient Loop Temperature Setpoint Measure" for altering loop temperature setpoints. This measure will be extended to support
	different types of HVAC systems in the future.
