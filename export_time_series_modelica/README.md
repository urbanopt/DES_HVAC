# ExportTimeSeriesLoadsCSV

## Description
This measure will create a CSV file with plant loop level loads for use in a Modelica simulation. This measure is intended for use in conjunction with the
	 Generate Time Series for Hydronic HVAC System measure.

## Modeler Description
This measure is currently configured to output the "Plant Supply Side Cooling Demand Rate" and "Plant Supply Side Heating Demand Rate" from the chilled water
	and hot water loops, respectively, in a CSV file. These loads represent the sum of the demand-side loads, and could thus represent the load on a connection to a district thermal energy system, or on
	building-level primary equipment. This measure assumes that the heating and cooling hydronic loops are named as they are in the configuration generated by 
	the "Add Sys7 VAV w Reheat" measure. It will be made more generic in the future.
